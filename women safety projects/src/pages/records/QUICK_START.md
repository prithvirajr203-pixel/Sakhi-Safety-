# 🚀 Quick Start Checklist

## Phase 1: Setup (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Review IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Verify all 7 files are in place:
  - [ ] `src/pages/records/myrecordshub.jsx`

  ```jsx
  <Route path="/records" element={<MyRecordsHub />} />
  <Route path="/records/new-complaint" element={<NewComplaint />} />
  ```

  - [ ] Check Network tab in DevTools for API responses

- [ ] Set up file upload handling:
  - [ ] Configure backend file upload endpoint

  - [ ] Set up file storage (local, cloud, etc.)

## Phase 5: Component Integration (15-20 minutes)
- [ ] Connect MyRecordsHub to real data:
  - [ ] Replace mock data with useRecords hook
  - [ ] Update statistics to show real numbers
  - [ ] Implement filtering and search
  - [ ] Test with real MongoDB data

- [ ] Connect NewComplaint to backend:
  - [ ] Replace mock submit handler with actual API call
  - [ ] Implement file upload to backend
  - [ ] Handle success/error responses
  - [ ] Clear form after successful submission

## Phase 6: Testing (15-20 minutes)
